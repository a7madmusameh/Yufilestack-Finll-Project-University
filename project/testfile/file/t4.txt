The Need for and Role of Databasesin an Organization
Database’s predominant role is to support managerial decision making at all levels
DBMS facilitates:
Interpretation and presentation of data
Distribution of data and information
Preservation and monitoring of data
Control over data duplication and use
Three levels to organization management:
Top, middle, operational

The DBA’s Managerial Role
DBA responsible for:
Coordinating, monitoring, allocating resources
Resources include people and data
Defining goals and formulating strategic plans
Interacts with end user by providing data and information
Enforces policies, standards, procedures

The DBA’s Managerial Role (cont’d.)
Manages security, privacy, integrity
Ensures data can be fully recovered
In large organizations, database security officer (DSO) responsible for disaster management
Ensures data is distributed appropriately
Makes it easy for authorized end users to access the database

The DBA’s Technical Role
Evaluates, selects, and installs DBMS and related utilities
Designs and implements databases and applications
Tests and evaluates databases and applications

The DBA’s Technical Role (cont’d.)
Operates DBMS, utilities, and applications
Trains and supports users
Maintains DBMS, utilities, and applications

The DBA’s Role in the Cloud
Cloud services provide: 
DBMS installation and updates
Server/network management
Backup and recovery operations
DBA’s managerial role is largely unchanged

Security
Securing data entails securing overall information system architecture
Confidentiality: data protected against unauthorized access
Integrity: keep data consistent and free of errors or anomalies
Availability: accessibility of data by authorized users for authorized purposes

Security Policies
Database security officer secures the system and the data
Works with the database administrator
Security policy: collection of standards, policies, procedures to guarantee security
Ensures auditing and compliance
Security audit process identifies security vulnerabilities
Identifies measures to protect the system

Security Vulnerabilities
Security vulnerability: weakness in a system component
Could allow unauthorized access or cause service disruptions
Security threat: imminent security violation
Could occur at any time
Security breach yields a database whose integrity is either:
Preserved	
Corrupted

Database Security
Refers to the use of DBMS features and other measures to comply with security requirements
DBA secures DBMS from installation through operation and maintenance
Authorization management
User access management
View definition
DBMS access control
DBMS usage monitoring

Database Administration Tools
Data dictionary
CASE tools

The Data Dictionary
Two main types of data dictionaries:
Integrated
Standalone
Active data dictionary is automatically updated by the DBMS with every database access
Passive data dictionary requires running a batch process 
Main function: store description of all objects that interact with database

The Data Dictionary (cont’d.)
Data dictionary that includes data external to DBMS becomes flexible tool
Enables use and allocation of all of an organization’s information
Metadata is often the basis for monitoring database use
Also for assigning access rights to users
DBA uses data dictionary to support data analysis and design 

CASE Tools
Computer-aided systems engineering
Automated framework for SDLC
Structured methodologies and powerful graphical interfaces
Front-end CASE tools provide support for planning, analysis, and design phases
Back-end CASE tools provide support for coding and implementation phases

CASE Tools (cont’d.)
Typical CASE tool has five components
Graphics for diagrams
Screen painters and report generators
Integrated repository
Analysis segment 
Program documentation generator

Developing a Data Administration Strategy 

Information engineering (IE) translates strategic goals into data and applications
Information systems architecture (ISA) is the output of IE process
Implementing IE is a costly process
Provides a framework that includes use of computerized, automated, and integrated tools
Success of information systems strategy depends on critical success factors
Managerial, technological, and corporate culture

The  DBA at Work: Using Oracle for Database Administration
Technical tasks handled by the DBA in a specific DBMS:
Creating and expanding database storage structures
Managing database objects
Managing end-user database environment
Customizing database initialization parameters
All DBMS vendors provide programs to perform database administrative tasks

The Default Login
Must connect to the database to perform administrative tasks
Username with administrative privileges
Oracle automatically creates SYSTEM and SYS user IDs with administrative privileges
Define preferred credentials by clicking on Preferences link, then Preferred Credentials
Username and passwords are database-specific

Ensuring that the RDBMS Starts Automatically
DBA ensures database access is automatically started when computer turned on
A service is a Windows system name for a special program that runs automatically
Part of the operating system
Database instance: separate location in memory reserved to run the database
May have several databases running in memory at the same time

Creating Tablespaces and Datafiles
Database composed of one or more tablespaces
Tablespace is a logical storage space
Physically stored in one or more datafiles
Datafile physically stores the database’s data
Each datafile can reside in a different directory on the hard disk
Database has 1:M relationship with tablespaces
Tablespace has 1:M relationship with datafiles

Managing the Database Objects: Tables, Views, Triggers, and Procedures
Database object: any object created by end users
Schema: logical section of the database that belongs to a given user
Schema identified by a username
Within the schema, users create their own tables and other objects
Normally, users are authorized to access only the objects that belong to their own schemas

Managing Users and Establishing Security
User: uniquely identifiable object
Allows a given person to log on to the database
Role: a named collection of database access privileges
Authorizes a user to connect to the database and use system resources
Profile: named collection of settings
Controls how much of a resource a given user can use

Customizing the Database Initialization Parameters
Fine-tuning requires modification of database configuration parameters
Some are changed in real time using SQL
Some affect database instance
Others affect entire RDBMS and all instances 
Initialization parameters reserve resources used by the database at run time
After modifying parameters, may need to restart the database

Summary
Data management is a critical activity for any organization
Data should be treated as a corporate asset 
DBMS is the most commonly used electronic tool for corporate data management
DBMS has impact on organization’s managerial, technological, and cultural framework
Data administration function evolved from centralized electronic data processing

Summary (cont’d.) 
Database administrator (DBA) is responsible for managing corporate database
Broader data management activity is handled by data administrator (DA)
DA is more managerially oriented than more technically oriented DBA
DA function is DBMS-independent
DBA function is more DBMS-dependent
When there is no DA, DBA executes all DA functions

Summary (cont’d.) 
Managerial services of DBA function:
Supporting end-user community
Defining and enforcing policies, procedures, and standards for database function
Ensuring data security, privacy, and integrity
Providing data backup and recovery services
Monitoring distribution and use of data in database

Summary (cont’d.) 
Technical role of DBA:
Evaluating, selecting, and installing DBMS
Designing and implementing databases and applications
Testing and evaluating databases and applications
Operating DBMS, utilities, and applications
Training and supporting users
Maintaining DBMS, utilities, and applications

Summary (cont’d.) 
Security: ensures confidentiality, integrity, availability of information system and data
Security policy: collection of standards, policies, and practices
Security vulnerability: weakness in system component
Information engineering guides development of data administration strategy
CASE tools and data dictionaries translate strategic plans to operational plans
